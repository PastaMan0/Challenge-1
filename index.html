    <p>When I think about my favorite apps that I use almost everyday it would be <em>spotify</em>. I use it to listen to music (What else would I do with it.) But, what I dont like about it is the amount of ads there are in a single rotation. Lets just say your trying to listen to <strong>Ed Sheeran "Perfect"</strong> (Anybody who actully listen to this song who still isn't in middle school or 10 years old should be thrown in jail with the death penalty btw) and lets say you get the song on the 5 attempt if your lucky (Or if you have <em>spotify</em> premium) you won't run into too many times probably only 2 times (8 adds) but if you end you with ads there is a chance that you get 3 or 4 if spotify doesn't like you for some reason (12 or 16 ads) at that point you should start to consider to another song you will hopefully get the first time (Should have done that already because of the orignal song plan "Perfect" ). Another problem with these ads is that they're to long for music ads (30-60s) and you can't skip them leading you to just turn off the voulme so you dont have to listen to those annyoing ads (These ads have caused me more suffering than anything combined) then you end up zoning out for like 3-5 mins then you realize that you were zoned out for that long with the volume turned on so you end up having an extenstial crisis about whether or not you should keeping going with the current songs or just change at this point (You should considering what song that is) then your entire mood is ruined until you realize you can just listen to it on youtube and then you remember your in a place with a terrible singal. Knowing that you get more peeved off knowing that you have to wait until you get home or somewhere with good singal in order to listen to the song (Literally just change it atp). Then you just give up, going to the daily mix to try and find it. Eventally you find it (Sadly) then everytime you try to replay you get interupted again and again until you decide your done with it (I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE). Thats when you get home and stop using it until the next day with the <strong>cycle of pain and misrey continuing</strong>. But, beyond that I think spotify is okay even with the ads.
